# The Budget Project

A personal and family finance management tool designed to help users maintain healthy financial habits.

## Overview

The Budget Project is a work-in-progress financial planning application that provides users with a clear understanding of their monthly spending capacity. By tracking income and expenses across different accounts, the system aims to guide individuals and families toward responsible and sustainable financial decision-making.

## Goals

- Empower users with **situational awareness** of their finances.
- Clearly identify **how much can be spent** each month without financial harm.
- Support detailed **budget planning** and tracking over time.
- Manage **income**, **expenses**, **transfers**, and **projected transactions**.

## Key Concepts

- **Accounting Cycle**: A monthly cycle where income and outcomes are considered.
- **Transaction**: Any movement of capital (expense, income, transfer).
- **Account Balance**: Represents a source of capital (e.g., bank account, wallet).
